## A Poem About Penguins

In icy realms where snowflakes dance,
The penguins waddle, take their chance.
With tuxedo coats of black and white,
They brave the cold both day and night.

They slide on bellies, dive so deep,
While fish and krill they hunt and keep.
In colonies they stand so tall,
Protecting young, one and all.

From Emperor to Little Blue,
These birds are loyal, strong, and true.
So here's to penguins, bold and grand,
The finest birds in all the land!
