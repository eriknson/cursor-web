## Winter Poem ❄️

The snow falls gently from the sky,
A blanket white, soft and high.
The trees stand bare against the cold,
Their branches silver, stories told.

The world grows quiet, still and bright,
As winter wraps us in its light.
A time for warmth, for rest, for cheer,
Until the springtime draws near.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
